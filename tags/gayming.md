title: Why is the channel called "gayming"?
color: pink

"gayming" is the correct spelling to describe the action of playing video gaymes. The common misconception that it should be spelled "gaming" stems from the erroneous yet widespread use of "game" instead of "gayme".

This channel helps inform of proper lingustics in the face of rampant misspelling. ||This is a joke, though we do love our fellow gaymers out here :rainbow:||
